                Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more sense with what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.

                    As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that’s not finished or doesn’t look perfect. You will learn to accept feedback and learn from it.

                    It has to be a problem that’s personally affecting or affected you, like finding your keys, calling a taxi or even remembering something. Open your eyes, look around you carefully and pay close attention to your surroundings.

                    It's time to look for solutions. What can you do to solve these problems? It's time to think out of the box, grab your notebook and start writing down all the ideas that come to mind.

                    How can design help solve your problem? It's time to think about features and functionality, and then start designing. Don’t forget to always ask yourself: Would I actually use this?
